Habit & Task Management: Create, read, update, and delete daily tasks and long-term habits.

Interactive Calendar View: A full-screen calendar to visualize tasks and select specific days.

Real-time Data Sync: All data is stored and synchronized in real-time across devices using Cloud Firestore.

Modern UI: A clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Material 3, supporting both light and dark modes.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is built with a modern tech stack and follows the principles of Clean Architecture with an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

Architecture
Clean Architecture: Separates the project into three distinct layers (Domain, Data, and Presentation) to promote separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

MVVM: The presentation layer uses the MVVM pattern, where the View (Composables) observes state changes from the ViewModel.

Tech Stack
UI: Jetpack Compose with Material 3 for a fully declarative and modern UI.

Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for managing background threads and handling streams of data.

Dependency Injection: Hilt for managing dependencies throughout the app.

Navigation: Navigation Compose for handling navigation between screens.

Database:

Remote: Cloud Firestore for real-time, multi-user data storage.

Local: Room for offline caching.

Authentication: Firebase Authentication for secure user management.

Logging: Timber for smart and efficient logging.


ðŸš€ Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to configure your Firebase backend.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mitdrak/TaskManager.git
cd TaskManager

2. Firebase Configuration:

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add an Android app to your Firebase project with the package name com.example.taskmanager.

Follow the setup instructions to download the google-services.json file.

Place the downloaded google-services.json file in the app/ directory of this project.

Enable Services: In the Firebase console, enable Authentication (with the Email/Password provider) and Cloud Firestore.

3. Firestore Database Setup:

In the Cloud Firestore section of the console, create your database.

Create a root collection named users. This is where the app will store data for each user in a document identified by their unique Firebase UID.

Security Rules: Go to the "Rules" tab in Firestore and paste the following rules to ensure users can only access their own data. This is a critical security step.

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents {
// Users can only read and write their own document in the 'users' collection
match /users/{userId} {
allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;

      // Users can only read and write tasks within their own document
      match /tasks/{taskId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
}
}

4. Build and Run:

Open the project in Android Studio.

Let Gradle sync the dependencies.

Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
